      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> The Supersonic Concorde was a jet that could fly at Mach 2 or about two times the speed of sound. The four main companies that make aircraft, Boeing, founded in 1916 in Seattle, Washington; Douglas, founded in 1921 in Santa Monica, California; McDonnell, founded in 1939 in St. Louis, Missouri; and Airbus, founded in 1974 in Blagnac, France. Today, only Boeing and Airbus remain as major players because of mergers. To understand how the jet airplanes advanced, we have to look at the 1950s when the jet age began to take off.
